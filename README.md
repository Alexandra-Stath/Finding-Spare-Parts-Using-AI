# Finding-Spare-Parts-Using-AI
This is a repository for our University (AUEB) course lesson "Programming 2".  In this project we use AI technologies with Java programming language and Maven as a build automation and project management tool. Our project helps mechanics easily find and suggest the best suited spare parts for customers' cars.
